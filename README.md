# Spacey API

A simple REST API written in Flask Python... It returns cool facts about space and the things related to astronomy. It also returns cool facts about the planets in our solar system.
This API was previously in GO but it was too overkill for a simple API.

## Requirements
API supports `PostGreSQL` by default although you can use other DBMS if you want to as long as SQLAlchemy supports it. When creating a PostGres DB, make sure that the config name matches the database in `api/config.py`

API uses [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for linting the code.

## Contributing
Since a boilerplate.. is a boilerplate, nothing much needs to change but here are some of the ways:

* Contributing to the source code.
* Contributing to the documentation of the APIs.
* Suggesting improvements, features, fixes, and so on.
* A coffee for me.
