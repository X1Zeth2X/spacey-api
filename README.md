# Flask RESTPlus Boilerplate

## What is it?
This is a boilerplate written in Python 3.6+ and Flask RESTPlus. It has the usual API services like authentication and CRUD.

## Features
* Fully featured RESTFul routes for authentication, and some CRUD user entity.
* JWT Authentication and Session.
* API Docs using Swagger UI.
* Rate limiting with Flask-Limiter can easily be enabled.
* Unit Testing

> 1. Flask-RESTPlus: Fully featured framework for fast, easy and documented API development with Flask
> 2. Flask-SQLAlchemy: an extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy to your application. It aims to simplify using SQLAlchemy with Flask by providing useful defaults and extra helpers that make it easier to accomplish common tasks.
> 3. Flask-JWT-Extended: an open source Flask extension that provides JWT support (with batteries included)!
> 4. Bcrypt: Modern password hashing for your software and your servers

## Requirements
API supports `PostGreSQL` by default although you can use other DBMS if you want to as long as SQLAlchemy supports it. When creating a PostGres DB, make sure that the config name matches the database in `api/config.py`

API uses [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for linting the code.

## Contributing
Since a boilerplate.. is a boilerplate, nothing much needs to change but here are some of the ways:

* Contributing to the source code.
* Contributing to the documentation of the APIs.
* Suggesting improvements, features, fixes, and so on.
* A coffee for me.
