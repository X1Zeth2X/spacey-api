# NAQL - Backend

## What is it?
NAQL's backend written in Python 3.6+. NAQL-API is a free and open source REST API that aims to be
an OpenSaaS bus assistant application where the school can monitor the student's bus activity,
reports, incidents, and more.

**@todo - Add FE Repo Link.**

## Requirements
NAQL supports `PostGreSQL` by default although you can use other DBMS if you want to as long as SQLAlchemy supports it.
When creating a PostGres DB, make sure that the config name matches the database in `src/config.py`

NAQL-API uses [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) for linting the code.
